Project Dependancies: 
    Database:
        PostgreSQL 
        Python3
        psycopg2
    GUI:
        Forthcoming. 
        

For now, all Python scripts should be edited to fit the local environment.  
Until we can get a working shared environment, you'll have to set up the PostgreSQL 
database on your local machine if you want to test this. 
    
This file will be updated with pertinent information as it develops and time allows.
